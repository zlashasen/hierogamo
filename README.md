# hierogamo
A simple HTML-game for learning Greek and Hebrew.

The general idea is that the player has to respond to the text-string that drops from the sky. The string can be in either Biblical Greek, Biblical Hebrew or both.

In the first version it is simply about learning how to write the different letters on a keyboard. Then it will gradually become more complex.
